title: Platforms (icons)
---

Find available social media / platform icons in `src/_includes/svg` (prefixed with `platform-`).
If you add new icons they too must be prefixed with "platform-".

In `personal.yaml` you can add new platforms and their URLs. The key must be the same as the prefix of the icon.

https://simpleicons.org/ features a great variety of free SVG icons for popular brands.
